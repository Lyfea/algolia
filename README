I am using Flask for the REST API and the language used is Python3.

For lauching the first time:
$ virtualenv flask
$ flask/bin/pip install flask
$ ./src/main.py tsv_file
Next times: ./src/main.py tsv_file

Request (or via navigator):
$ curl localhost:5000/1/queries/count/2015
$ curl localhost:5000/1/queries/popular/2015-08-03?size=5

Implementation:
All the data are loaded in RAM. It is stored in a map of query and list of date
as: { ["foobar", ["2015-08-02", "2015-09-03"]], ["foo", ["2015-08-04"]] }
The list's queries are sorted by date and the queries are sorted by their first
date. Sorting them enable to have one more stop-case in the search.

I asserted that most of the queries are redondant given enough data thus I
associated to each query its dates.
For the distinct count, it avoids the storing of the queries: each query is
unique in the map thus we do not have to check the distinctness.
For the popular count, it avoids the storing of each query associated with
their count. We just add the query and its count in a list if the later is
superior to one of the N most popular queries.
